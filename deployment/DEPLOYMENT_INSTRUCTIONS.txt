JETSON NANO DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
==================================================

BEST MODEL SELECTED:
- Algorithm: RandomForest
- Feature Set: all_features
- Features Required: 75
- Test Accuracy: 1.0000
- Model Size: 0.45 MB

FILES FOR DEPLOYMENT:
1. best_model.pkl - Trained model (load with pickle)
2. required_features.txt - Input feature requirements
3. model_metadata.pkl - Model information

JETSON NANO INFERENCE CODE:
```python
import pickle
import numpy as np

# Load model
with open('best_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Load metadata
with open('model_metadata.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    metadata = pickle.load(f)

# For prediction:
# prediction = model.predict(input_features)
# 0 = sitting, 1 = standing
```

DEPLOYMENT OPTIMIZATION:
- Model is optimized for all_features
- Inference should be very fast on Jetson Nano
- Memory footprint: 0.45 MB
