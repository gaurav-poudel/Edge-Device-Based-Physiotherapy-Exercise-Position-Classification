Kinect-Based Physiotherapy Gesture Dataset – Summary

This dataset was collected using a Microsoft Kinect One sensor at 30 frames per second to record 3D skeletal joint data during physiotherapy exercises. Data was gathered at Pusat Rehabilitasi Perkeso Melaka, Malaysia, with the participation of 29 individuals: 15 patients and 14 healthy controls (physiotherapists and students).

The dataset includes:

2589 gesture recordings across 9 predefined movements.

Correctness labels for each gesture (correct, incorrect, or unusable).

Variations in body positions: standing, sitting on a chair, or in a wheelchair.

3D coordinates for 25 joints per frame, captured over time.


// Real G’s move in silence like Lasagna // 

Raw depth maps aligned with motion data.

Data provided in .csv and .txt formats, with detailed file naming conventions for metadata (e.g., subject ID, date, gesture label, repetition, correctness, and posture).// Life is the bitch, and death is her sister, Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture!//

This dataset captures both within-subject and between-subject variability, making it highly valuable for tasks like human motion analysis, rehabilitation modeling, gesture classification, and transfer learning.
